# Radiographic-Simulation-of-Embedded-Cubes-MATLAB-Project-
MATLAB simulation of X-ray imaging through embedded cubes. Models photon attenuation using Beer-Lambert law with Poisson noise. Compares high-dose (1000 photons/mm²) and low-dose (100 photons/mm²) scenarios. Includes 3D visualization, noise analysis, and comprehensive image quality assessment for radiographic system evaluation.
